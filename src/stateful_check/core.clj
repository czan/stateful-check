(defn specification-correct?
  "Test whether or not the specification matches reality. This
  generates test cases and runs them. If run with in an `is`, it will
  report details (and pretty-print them) if it fails.

  The `options` map consists of three potential keys: `:gen`, `:run`,
  and `:report`, each of which influence a different part of the test.

  `:gen` has four sub-keys:
   - `:threads` specifies how many parallel threads to execute
   - `:max-length` specifies a max length for command sequences
   - `:max-size` specifies a maximum size for generated values
   - `:shrink-strategies` specifies a sequence of shrink strategies
     that should be tried (in order) to reduce the size of a failing
     test (see `stateful-check.generator/default-shrink-strategies`
     and `stateful-check.shrink-strategies`)

  `:run` has three sub-keys:
   - `:max-tries` specifies how attempts to make to fail a test
   - `:num-tests` specifies how many tests to run
   - `:seed` specifies the initial seed to use for generation
   - `:timeout-ms` specifies the maximum number of milliseconds that a
     test is permitted to run for - taking longer is considered a
     failure (default: 0, meaning no timeout; see NOTE below for more
     details)

  `:report` has two sub-keys, but only works within an `is`:
   - `:first-case?` specifies whether to print the first failure
   - `:stacktrace?` specifies whether to print exception stacktraces

  The `:timeout-ms` option is unsafe in general, but may be helpful in
  some circumstances. It allows you to categorise a test as a failure
  if it takes more than a given time, but each of the threads must
  respond to being interrupted by completing and shutting down. If
  these threads do not shut themselves down then they may continue to
  consume system resources (CPU and memory, among other things),
  impacting other tests."
